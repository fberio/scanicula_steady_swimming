<ins>This repository contains variables describing the swimming kinematics of the small-spotted catshark <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> across 11 speeds.</ins> More specifically, the files contain:
- kinematics data computed from 2D midline coordinates (for data processing, see [Goerig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bg79cnp9x)), including maximum curvature location along the body, maximum curvature value, wave speed, tail beat frequency, head amplitude, tail amplitude, head:tail amplitude, Reynolds number, Strouhal number, and wavelength. There is one value for each speed x specimen combination.
- 2D body angle for each speed x specimen, with one value every 10 frames
- 3D angle of attack of the left pectoral fin for each speed x specimen, with one value every 10 frames
